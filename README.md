Polyploid expansion
==================

A initial repo for the project of polyploid and standing genetic variation in an expanding wave built off initial idea of Peischl and Excoffier in [Expansion load: recessive mutations and the role of standing genetic variation] (http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/11/18/011593).

## Main question:
1. If mutations are fully (or perhaps even partially) recessive for which there is evidence (see Agrawal 2011) - then are polyploids at an advantage for escaping both hard and soft selection?

**Hypothesis/Prediction**: 
Under recessive model: aaaa is bad for tetraploids, but more ways to escape with aaaA, aaAA, aAAA, and AAAA.

Whereas diploids have only two ways to escape selection with: aA and AA. 

Will need to update with some initial scripts, and incorporate demes and grid.
